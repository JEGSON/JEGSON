## Hi there 👋
 I'm **Jegede Olasunkanmi**
- 🚀 DevOps Engineer focused on cloud infrastructure, CI/CD automation, container orchestration, and infrastructure as code.
- 🧰 I build tooling in Python, PowerShell, and Terraform to streamline platform operations and developer workflows.
- ☁️ Hands-on with AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions, and Linux automation across several end-to-end learning projects.
- 🎯 Currently sharpening observability, release reliability, and platform governance for production-ready systems.

🔭 What I'm Exploring

- Extending my Server Monitor project with richer alert routing and dashboards.
- Hardening Terraform stacks for reusable AWS environments.
- Streamlining GitHub Actions pipelines for multi-service applications.
